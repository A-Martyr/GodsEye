# requiring 0.15 accepts 46 at 100%. The floor alone is a much blunter
# instrument. The floor is kept tighter than the sweep strictly needs because
# that sweep under-represents the case the floor exists for: the simulator's
# camera coverage is dense, so the true plate was in the candidate set 93.3% of
# the time. On a network with real gaps that share is lower and the floor is
# what stops a confident-looking wrong candidate getting through.
