"""City traffic simulator — the stand-in for a live ANPR camera network.

A fleet of vehicles is routed across the camera graph on realistic origin-
destination demand, with a time-of-day profile and standing congestion on the
corridors that are actually congested in Kolkata. Every time a vehicle passes
a camera the simulator produces a *plate image*, degrades it for the conditions
at that camera at that hour, and pushes it through the real OCR engine. What
lands in the database is therefore what the engine read - errors included -
which is the point: the trajectory and analytics layers have to cope with
imperfect reads exactly as they would in deployment.

Each camera contributes a *burst* per vehicle, not a single frame, which is what
a loop-triggered ANPR node actually does; the frames are read independently and
voted. That costs roughly `BURST_FRAMES` x 75 ms per vehicle, so live mode caps
how many frames are decoded per tick and falls back to a calibrated error model
for the rest; `ocr_mode` on each sighting records which path produced it.
