"""EasyOCR backend — an evaluated alternative, not a default engine path.

Prompted by a real question: our CRNN (`anpr/crnn.py`) is trained entirely on
synthetic captures and reads 0% of held-out real plates exactly right.
EasyOCR is a pretrained scene-text reader trained on large
real-world text corpora — the exact domain our CRNN never saw. This wrapper
exists to measure whether that generalises to real plate crops, via
`anpr/compare_backends.py --real`.

Deliberately not wired into anything else: no confidence-floor calibration
(`PlateRead.floor` falls back to the classical scale for this backend, which
is almost certainly wrong for it), no `core/repair.py` integration (EasyOCR
returns text + a per-detection score, not a scoreable lattice over arbitrary
candidate strings the way CRNN's CTC logits are), and no default-engine
wiring in sim/api/dashboard. Construct explicitly via `load()` and pass as
`ANPREngine(easyocr_reader=...)` to use it.
