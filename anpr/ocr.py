"""The GodsEye ANPR engine.

Pipeline
--------
    plate crop
      -> normalise (deskew, CLAHE, fixed height)      segment.normalize
      -> flatten illumination + Otsu -> ink mask       segment.binarize
      -> over-segment into atoms                       segment.segment
      -> format-constrained decode  <-- this module
      -> plate string + per-character confidence

The decoder is what lifts accuracy on bad captures. Classical ANPR pipelines
commit to one segmentation and then classify; a smeared "KA" that fused into one
blob, or a "0" that broke into two fragments, is then unrecoverable. Here the
segmenter is deliberately allowed to over-cut, and a dynamic program searches
every way of grouping 1-3 adjacent atoms into characters, scoring each grouping
against the Bharat-series plate grammar (LL DD LLL DDDD). The grammar rules out
whole families of classifier errors - a digit can never win a letter slot - and
the DP recovers merges and splits that a fixed segmentation cannot.
